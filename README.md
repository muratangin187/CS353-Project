## Overview
**Ucollege** is an online course platform with high emphasis on interactivity and learning by practice. There are three types of members (persons in this context): users, creators, and admins. Users can search for different courses with different parameters, buy the course if they have sufficient funds, add courses to their wish lists and carts, rate courses after finishing them. They can also update them. They earn a certificate from their course when they complete the course. A user can participate in quizzes of bought courses, watch its lectures, ask questions, get notified by announcements, and request a refund if the course is not finished. A user can add bookmarks and notes for a lecture, and can look at the additional material related to that lecture, added by the creator. Users can add balance to their courses, can display their certificates. Creators can create courses. In these courses, the creator can add or delete lectures, add or delete announcements, answer questions, add quizzes. In terms of lectures, they can add additional material for users, change the lectures visibility, and delete the lecture. In terms of quizzes, they can create new quizzes for a specific course, consisting of multiple choice or true-false questions at the same time. Creators can specify time and put different constraints for the quiz. Users can get feedback on their performance, learning their scores. Creators can allow discounts and disable them, offered by admins. Admins can check refund requests made by users, then approve/reject these requests, notifying the users. Moreover, admins can display some in-site statistics and analytics regarding the **Ucollege**. Admins can offer discounts for a course.
